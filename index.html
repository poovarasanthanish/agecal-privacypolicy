  <h1>Privacy Policy for Birthday Wishes</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 14, 2025</p>

  <p><strong>VillageFast</strong> ("we", "us", or "our") operates the Birthday Wishes mobile application (the "Service"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information when you use the Service.</p>

  <h3>2. Third-Party Services</h3>
  <p>We use third-party services that may collect information about you. Please review their policies directly. These include (but may not be limited to):</p>

    <li><strong>Google AR Services:</strong> if AR features are present, camera frames may be processed by Google for AR experiences; Google deletes images after processing and does not link them to your Google account.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <p>We use collected data to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and maintain the Service.</li>
    <li>Deliver and personalize advertisements to keep the app free.</li>
    <li>Analyze usage and improve app features and performance.</li>
    <li>Measure marketing and ad campaign effectiveness.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>With service providers (e.g., Google for ads, analytics, AR services).</li>
    <li>To comply with legal obligations or valid law enforcement requests.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights such as accessing, correcting, or deleting your personal information. You can also reset your device Advertising ID via device settings to limit ad personalization.</p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>We implement commercially reasonable measures to protect your data. However, no transmission or storage method is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>The Service is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us with information, contact us to request deletion.</p>
